Assignment 1.10/Choose your own

04/26/2019	Made ball.h, ball.cpp. paddle.h, and paddle.h files.
		- Created a ball object with base values for initial position and speed.
		- Created paddle objects with base y positions and x positions.
		- Made a very basic pong.cpp file that would print the ball and paddles to the screen.
		
04/28/2019	- Created a function that accepted user input to move the paddles.
		- Created a function that would update the screen periodically, redrawing the ball
		and paddles as they moved.
		- Added a couple more getter/setter functions to the paddle and ball classes.
		- Defined a lot of constants that I frequently use.
		- Added functions that check to see if the ball hits the paddles, and then changes direction
		based on that.
		- Added score to the paddles and update it if a player gets the ball past the other player's paddle.
		- Added checks to see if that ball hit a wall.
		- Added some randomness to the ball movement when it hits a paddle to prevent infinite looping.
		- Added a reset method that resets the ball and paddles when someone scores.
		- Added a beginning screen and ending screen. The beginning screen tells the users how to play.
