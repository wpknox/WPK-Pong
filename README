For the choose your own assignment I decided to make a pong game.

There are two players. Player one controls the left paddle and player two controls the right paddle.
Player one uses 'w' and 's' to move the paddle and player two uses 'i' and 'k'
Either player can press 'q' to quit the game at any time. Otherwise, the game ends if either of the
players reaches 10 points.
The paddles are made in paddle.h and paddle.cpp and the ball is made in ball.h and ball.cpp.
The main file where the game runs is pong.cpp
